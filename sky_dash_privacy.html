<h1>Privacy Policy — Sky Dash</h1>
<p><em>Last updated: 2025-08-21</em></p>
<p>Sky Dash is a simple HTML5 game built for Meta Instant Games (Facebook). This policy describes how we handle information.</p>
<h2>Data We Process</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Facebook-provided basic profile data</strong> (such as name or ID) may be accessed only to support platform features like leaderboards or sharing. We do not store this data on our own servers.</li>
  <li><strong>Local device data</strong>: the game stores your best score and preferences locally in your browser using localStorage. This never leaves your device.</li>
  <li><strong>Facebook Platform Analytics</strong> may collect aggregated usage metrics as part of Meta’s platform services.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Payments</h2>
<p>If in-app purchases are enabled in the future, payments will be processed by Meta. We will not receive or store your payment card details.</p>
<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not sell or rent your personal data. We only share data as necessary to operate the game on Meta’s platform or to comply with the law.</p>
<h2>Data Retention</h2>
<p>We do not keep personal data on our servers. Local scores remain on your device until you clear your browser storage or remove the game from your Facebook account.</p>
<h2>Access, Deletion, and Contact</h2>
<p>To remove the game’s connection and data on Facebook, you can remove the Sky Dash app from your Facebook settings. You can also request deletion by following the instructions on our Data Deletion page.</p>
